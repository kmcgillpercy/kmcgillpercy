# About Me

Kyle McGill Percy is a third-year PhD candidate in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. His lifelong fascination with neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD), has been a driving force in his academic journey. AD, affecting 6.2 million individuals in the United States alone, presents profound challenges such as memory loss, impaired judgment, and daily life difficulties, often requiring extensive support from caregivers, placing significant burdens on families.

Having earned his Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Science in 2017 and his Master of Science in Medical Sciences, specializing in Aging & Neuroscience, in 2020 from the University of South Florida, Kyle embarked on his research path with [Dr. David Kang](https://www.kang-lab.com/)  and [Dr. JungA (Alexa) Woo](https://www.kang-lab.com/Woo%20members.html). In their lab, he delved into various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD), Frontotemporal dementia Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS) spectrum disorder, and Lewy Body disorder (LBDs). Kyle contributed to multiple projects, including the identification of the molecular mechanism of β-arrestin1—a protein closely interacting with GPCR—and its role in tauopathy. He also investigated the mitochondrial protein CHCHD2 and its implications in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in PD and other LBDs.

In 2023, Kyle transitioned to [Dr. Xin Qi’s lab](https://www.xinqi-lab.com/) as a PhD student, focusing on exploring the relationship between tauopathy and mitochondria, further deepening his understanding of neurodegenerative mechanisms.
