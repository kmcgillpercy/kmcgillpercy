    "text": "Tauopathy and Mitochondrial dysfunction\n  Ghua et al., Molecular Neurobiology 2020\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD), affecting 6.2 million individuals in the United States, stands as the most prevalent neurodegenerative condition. Within this category, tauopathies are distinguished by the aggregation of tau protein within neurons. In tauopathies, hyperphosphorylation prompts tau detachment from microtubules, inducing instability and aggregate formation, ultimately leading to neuronal death. Maintaining mitochondrial health is vital for neuronal function and survival, supporting ATP production and metabolism. Although the precise connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and tauopathy is yet unclear, research indicates that mitochondrial stress often precedes tau aggregation in models of tauopathy. Prolonged mitochondrial stress can trigger tau phosphorylation and aggregation, while tau aggregates can disrupt axonal transport of mitochondria, affecting mitochondrial function and dynamics. Despite the crucial roles of mitochondrial dysfunction in tauopathy, the mechanisms governing Tau-mitochondria interaction and its impact on disease progression and neurodegeneration remain uncertain."

    "text": "About Me\nKyle McGill Percy is a second-year PhD student in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. His lifelong fascination with neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD), has been a driving force in his academic journey. AD, affecting 6.2 million individuals in the United States alone, presents profound challenges such as memory loss, impaired judgment, and daily life difficulties, often requiring extensive support from caregivers, placing significant burdens on families.\nHaving earned his Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Science in 2017 and his Master of Science in Medical Sciences, specializing in Aging & Neuroscience, in 2020 from the University of South Florida, Kyle embarked on his research path with Dr. David Kang and Dr. Dr. JungA (Alexa) Woo. In their lab, he delved into various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD), Frontotemporal dementia Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS) spectrum disorder, and Lewy Body disorder (LBDs). Kyle contributed to multiple projects, including the identification of the molecular mechanism of β-arrestin1—a protein closely interacting with GPCR—and its role in tauopathy. He also investigated the mitochondrial protein CHCHD2 and its implications in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in PD and other LBDs.\nIn 2023, Kyle transitioned to Dr. Xin Qi’s lab as a PhD student, focusing on exploring the relationship between tauopathy and mitochondria, further deepening his understanding of neurodegenerative mechanisms."

No person shall operate a motor vehicle, trackless trolley, or streetcar at a speed greater or less than is reasonable or proper, having due regard to the traffic, surface, and width of the street or highway and any other conditions, and no person shall drive any motor vehicle, trackless trolley, or streetcar in and upon any street or highway at a greater speed than will permit the person to bring it to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead.\nOpening track, “His Boy Elroy” places MyHeartYourGlove as a band born in the midwest-emo, DIY-band fertile crescent of the rust belt by painting a cinematic collage of grief and trauma. Bookended by our secret sauce of pedalboard circuitry to generate Jetsons-inspired feedback signals and garnished with recorded sound effects, “His Boy Elroy” is a soulful rock-driven dirge that transports you to the existential danger of The Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways.\nTitle track, “Buick Killer” recounts the loss of a Buick LeSabre, owned by our vocalist, Jared, after it was hit by a drunk driver in an upbeat singer-songerwriter-meets-disco groove. We are happy to report that the driver has been apprehended, and the Buick LeSabre was repaired in time for our album’s photoshoot!\nShake the rust off your square dancing spurs with “Screw Factory XI”, a laid back instant-oldie about self acceptance and moving on from lost loves (both people and automobiles). Yeehaw!\n“What Do We Do Now?” wraps up the album with the wild angst and energy of myspace/soundcloud scramz balanced with the delicate precision, lush production, and hi-fi shimmery bloom, signature to MyHeartYourGlove. MyHeartYourGlove would like to thank our fans for patience in this release of songs we have been playing for you all for the better part of this past year and would like to remind them that We’ll Be Back Before You’re Gone!"

    "text": "Overstayed Your Welcome (2023)\n  Bandcamp,  Spotify,   Apple Music, \nMyHeartYourGlove’s debut into the genre of midwest emo!\nOpening track, Bill Haverchuck is a modern evocation of an internal struggle felt by titled character, Bill Haverchuck from the Emmy nominated show, Freaks and Geeks. Martin Starr (also known for playing anti-authoritarian satanist hacker, Bertram Gilfoyle in Silicon Valley, Conductor of the General, William Fuller in Drunk History as well as Boombox Guy in the the music video for Madeon’s Pop Culture) heartfelt performance as Bill Haverchuck captures the conflict between the joyful escape of television from an unkind and confusing world and the social consequences and isolation of retreating away from the people who care about you. Melancholy vocals and a pop-punk-adjacent groove build, collapse, and then bloom into a lush and atmospheric and somber interlude featuring Jared’s legendary Giga-Delay, expertly-satisfying cymbal crashes and a stereo shimmer reverb on the bass guitar track! A highly danceable bop with a nice break for mildly uncomfortable, but productive self-reflection.\n“It was a question I had worn on my lips for days - like a loose thread on my favourite sweater I couldn’t resist pulling - despite knowing it could all unravel around me.\n“Do you love me?” I ask.\nIn your hesitation I found my answer.” - Lang Leav, Love and Misadventure\nWith That Guy Has a Nice Sweater, MyHeartYourGlove joins the elite echelon of Weezer (Undone), The Promise Ring (12 Sweaters Red), and Spongebob (The Striped Sweater Song Live at the Krusty Krab 2001) of artists in the musical tradition of recognizing the emotional impact of cozy, but delicate outerwear.That Guy Has a Nice Sweater completes the album with a ballad of self-reflection, healing growth through perspective, and cycles of despair after a fractured relationship. Building soundscape of stadium-shaking drums, tastefully tight bass fills, and cleverly refined guitar riffs that soars above the mix, TGHaNS contrasts the delicate articulation of Bill Haverchuck with a rollercoaster of emotion and intensity!"
