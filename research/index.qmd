[Qi lab](https://www.xinqi-lab.com/) focuses on investigating the impact of mitochondrial quality control and metabolism on neurodegenerative diseases. We employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating proteomics, genomics, cell and molecular biology techniques, patient-derived iPS cell culture, and animal models to unravel the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction. Our research explores how this dysfunction contributes to impaired cellular metabolism, immune response dysregulation, and neurodegeneration.
Additionally, we utilize rationally designed peptide inhibitors of protein-protein interactions and high-throughput screening to pioneer "mitochondrial medicine" as a promising therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting 6.2 million individuals in the United States, stands as the most prevalent neurodegenerative condition. Within this category, tauopathies are distinguished by the aggregation of tau protein within neurons. In tauopathies, hyperphosphorylation prompts tau detachment from microtubules, inducing instability and aggregate formation, ultimately leading to neuronal death. Maintaining mitochondrial health is vital for neuronal function and survival, supporting ATP production and metabolism. Although the precise connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and tauopathy is yet unclear, research indicates that mitochondrial stress often precedes tau aggregation in models of tauopathy. Prolonged mitochondrial stress can trigger tau phosphorylation and aggregation, while tau aggregates can disrupt axonal transport of mitochondria, affecting mitochondrial function and dynamics. Despite the crucial roles of mitochondrial dysfunction in tauopathy, the mechanisms governing Tau-mitochondria interaction and its impact on disease progression and neurodegeneration remain uncertain.
