MyHeartYourGlove's 3rd release, and first release as a power trio with Jared taking over lead vocals.

Opening track, “His Boy Elroy” places MyHeartYourGlove as a band born in the midwest-emo, DIY-band fertile crescent of the rust belt by painting a cinematic collage of grief and trauma. Bookended by our secret sauce of pedalboard circuitry to generate Jetsons-inspired feedback signals and garnished with recorded sound effects, “His Boy Elroy” is a soulful rock-driven dirge that transports you to the existential danger of The Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways.

Title track, “Buick Killer” recounts the loss of a Buick LeSabre, owned by our vocalist, Jared, after it was hit by a drunk driver in an upbeat singer-songerwriter-meets-disco groove. We are happy to report that the driver has been apprehended, and the Buick LeSabre was repaired in time for our album's photoshoot!

Shake the rust off your square dancing spurs with “Screw Factory XI”, a laid back instant-oldie about self acceptance and moving on from lost loves (both people and automobiles). Yeehaw!

“What Do We Do Now?” wraps up the album with the wild angst and energy of myspace/soundcloud scramz balanced with the delicate precision, lush production, and hi-fi shimmery bloom, signature to MyHeartYourGlove. MyHeartYourGlove would like to thank our fans for patience in this release of songs we have been playing for you all for the better part of this past year and would like to remind them that We'll Be Back Before You're Gone!

MyHeartYourGlove's debut into the genre of midwest emo!

Opening track, Bill Haverchuck is a modern evocation of an internal struggle felt by titled character, Bill Haverchuck from the Emmy nominated show, Freaks and Geeks. Martin Starr (also known for playing anti-authoritarian satanist hacker, Bertram Gilfoyle in Silicon Valley, Conductor of the General, William Fuller in Drunk History as well as Boombox Guy in the the music video for Madeon's Pop Culture) heartfelt performance as Bill Haverchuck captures the conflict between the joyful escape of television from an unkind and confusing world and the social consequences and isolation of retreating away from the people who care about you. Melancholy vocals and a pop-punk-adjacent groove build, collapse, and then bloom into a lush and atmospheric and somber interlude featuring Jared's legendary Giga-Delay, expertly-satisfying cymbal crashes and a stereo shimmer reverb on the bass guitar track! A highly danceable bop with a nice break for mildly uncomfortable, but productive self-reflection.


“It was a question I had worn on my lips for days - like a loose thread on my favourite sweater I couldn't resist pulling - despite knowing it could all unravel around me.

"Do you love me?" I ask.

In your hesitation I found my answer.”
- Lang Leav, Love and Misadventure


With That Guy Has a Nice Sweater, MyHeartYourGlove joins the elite echelon of Weezer (Undone), The Promise Ring (12 Sweaters Red), and Spongebob (The Striped Sweater Song Live at the Krusty Krab 2001) of artists in the musical tradition of recognizing the emotional impact of cozy, but delicate outerwear.That Guy Has a Nice Sweater completes the album with a ballad of self-reflection, healing growth through perspective, and cycles of despair after a fractured relationship. Building soundscape of stadium-shaking drums, tastefully tight bass fills, and cleverly refined guitar riffs that soars above the mix, TGHaNS contrasts the delicate articulation of Bill Haverchuck with a rollercoaster of emotion and intensity!
